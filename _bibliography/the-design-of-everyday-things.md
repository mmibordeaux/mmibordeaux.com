summary: 'Design doesn’t have to complicated, which is why this guide to human-centered
  design shows that usability is just as important as aesthetics. Even the smartest
  among us can feel inept as we fail to figure out which light switch or oven burner
  to turn on, or whether to push, pull, or slide a door. The fault, argues this ingenious
  — even liberating — book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores
  the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range
  from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and
  functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable
  demands on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design
  is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships
  that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal:
  guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right
  time. The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how — and why — some
  products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.'
